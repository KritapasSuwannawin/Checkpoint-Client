        Checkpoint currently offers a [1-month] digital coupon and [3-month] digital coupon that users can purchase from
        Buy Me a Coffee. After [1-month] or [3-month] after the code is redeemed, your Premium subscription will be
        automatically suspended, given that you have not redeemed another code before the current plan expires.

        We hope you will be pleased with our service. Please note that once the payment has been made, either for a
        [1-month] or [3-month] plan, refund will not be made under any circumstances.
