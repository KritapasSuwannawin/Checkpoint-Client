      <p>
        This cookie policy explains how we use “cookies” and similar technologies (such as “web beacons”, “pixels” or
        “tags”) on our website at https://checkpoint.tokyo (“site”) operated by Checkpoint and in our marketing emails.
        It is designed to help you make informed decisions when using our Site and interacting with our communications.
        Please take a moment to read and understand this Cookie Policy. This Cookie Policy should also be read in
        conjunction with our Privacy Policy.

      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are very small text files or pieces of code, which often include an anonymous unique identifier. When
        you visit a website, the website sends information to your computer or mobile device and creates a text file
        that is then stored on your computer or mobile device. Information gathered through cookies may include the date
        and time of visits and show how people use the particular website or mobile application, usually so the website
        operator can make improvements. Amongst other things, cookies are also used to help you access a website and its
        content as efficiently as possible (by remembering you from your last visit) and to make sure you are presented
        with advertising that is relevant to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to cookies are technologies known as “web beacons”, “pixels or “tags”. These technologies do a similar
        job to cookies, allowing website operators to count page views and understand how visitors interact with and
        respond to certain content.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use “first party cookies” and “third party cookies”. First party cookies are cookies placed by us. Third
        party cookies are cookies placed by others. Information collected by third party cookies will be shared with the
        relevant third party. Please refer to the relevant third party’s privacy notice for more details about the
        information they collect and how they use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be aware that applications you use to access our Site, such as your web browser, may also place
        cookies on your device when visiting our Site, or other websites. An example of this would be where you sign in
        to Google Chrome using a Google Account. We have no control over these third party cookies, so you will need to
        manage these cookies in the settings of the relevant applications. For more general information on cookies and
        how they work, please visit{' '}

      <h2>How long do cookies last?</h2>
      <p>The lifespan of a cookie depends on its purpose and how you interact with it:</p>
      <p>
        Session Cookies – these are temporary cookies that are placed on your device during your browsing session and
        then automatically erased when you close your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Persistent Cookies – these are designed to last for a pre-defined period of time, which varies depending on the
        nature of the cookie. Persistent cookies stay in your browser until they reach their individual expiry date or
        you manually delete them.
      </p>

      <h2>Which cookies are used on our Site?</h2>
      <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>
      <p>
        Essential Cookies/Strictly Necessary Cookies – These cookies are those cookies which a website could not operate
        without. These include cookies such as login cookies and shopping cart cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functional Cookies – These cookies recognise you when you return to a website, remember your preferences and
        provide enhanced, more personalised features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performance Cookies – Performance cookies, along with other information, allow websites to calculate the
        aggregate number of people using a website and which features of a website are the most popular. This
        information is generally used to improve the website and the way visitors are able to move around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social Media Cookies – These cookies are used to personalise your interaction with social media, such as
        Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Such cookies recognise users of those social media sites when you view social
        media content on the website. They also allow you to quickly share content across social media, through the use
        of simple “sharing” buttons. Some websites may also contain features that enable you to use your social media
        account to sign in and create/maintain an account with the website you are visiting and to enable the website
        operator to store your content. This involves the use of cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Targeting Cookies – Targeting cookies (also known as advertising cookies) help us to deliver our adverts when
        you visit other websites, such as news websites. This is known as “retargeting”. This technique helps to ensure
        that the ads you receive are more relevant to you and your interests. These cookies help to measure the
        effectiveness of an ad and can also limit the number of times that you see an ad. These cookies are placed on
        your device by advertising networks that we and other advertisers work with to deliver ads. They remember what
        sites you visit and this information is shared with other ad networks to show you relevant ads.
      </p>

      <h2>Is consent needed to use cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Essential/Strictly Necessary Cookies – We do not need your consent to store and access essential cookies on your
        device, although you can still block or delete them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other (“non-essential”) Cookies – We may only store and access non-essential cookies on your device with your
        permission. You are not obliged to give consent to our use of non-essential cookies. If you do give your consent
        and then change your mind, you can still delete any cookies that have already been placed.
