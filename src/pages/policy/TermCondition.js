          <h2>Donation Specific Terms</h2>
          <ul>
            <p>
              By using the services of the donation portal, you as a user (hereinafter referred to as donor) agree to these terms and
              conditions of the donation portal.
            </p>
            <li>
              Validity. These terms and conditions apply to all one-off and ongoing donations portal within the scope of Checkpoint's
              activity and irrespective of the classification under contract law. They also apply to all future donations without the need
              for explicit acceptance. These terms and conditions shall be deemed accepted at the latest with your first donation. These
              terms and conditions as well as all further amendments are available online on the Checkpoint website and apply exclusively.
              Checkpoint reserves the right to amend these terms and conditions in any form at any time, without further notice and at its
              own discretion. Notification of changes at this point is recognized by the donor as sufficient notice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scope. We are a non-profit organization, the statutory purposes of Checkpoint, therefore, include all purposes that charitable
              movements might pursue. The donor turns his/her donation over to Checkpoint, which first adds it to its assets and then
              allocating it to the development of its app. In its function as a social movement, Checkpoint is therefore entitled to issue
              the donor with a donation receipt. The purpose of the donation is fulfilled by Checkpoint by using the funds received within
              the framework of Checkpoint's own purposes to develop the Checkpoint. Checkpoint decides on the use of the donations in
              respect to the development. There is no legal claim on the part of the donor or the favoured part of the Checkpoint. Depending
              on the selected transfer method, fees may be charged for the donation, which the respective provider will charge to
              Checkpoint. Donors have the choice of paying these fees themselves in addition to the donation; otherwise, the fees will be
              deducted from the intended donation before it is transferred to Checkpoint. The donor agrees to the transmission of the data
              required for the transfer of the donation to the implementing banks or to the transmission of the data required for the
              implementation of the donation by direct debit to the non-profit organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data protection of donors. Checkpoint uses SSL encryption technology when transmitting data. The data of the donors will only
              be stored for a short period of time for accounting, security and research reasons. The data is used exclusively for the
              purpose of transferring the donation to Checkpoint. The donor's personal data may be used by Checkpoint for the purpose of
              producing a donation receipt for the donor. Furthermore, the data may be used to remedy technical defects. They will not be
              forwarded to other organizations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Donors Responsibilities. By donating to Checkpoint you agree to provide true, accurate and up-to-date information about
              yourself as specified in the donation form. If it becomes known that any of the information you provide is untrue, inaccurate,
              outdated or incomplete, the Checkpoint reserves the right not to accept you as a donor in the future and to take other legal
              action if necessary. Donors undertake to comply with all applicable legal provisions when donating in order to prevent
              unlawful use. Furthermore, donors undertake to assume sole responsibility for compliance with such legal provisions.
