      </p>

      <h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, we would like to inform you about your rights as a data subject. These rights are standardised.
        This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The right to information,</li>
        <li>The right to erasure,</li>
        <li>The right to rectification,</li>
        <li>The right to data portability,</li>
        <li>The right to restriction of data processing,</li>
        <li>The right to object to data processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To assert these rights, please contact inquiry@checkpoint.tokyo. The same applies if you have questions about
        data processing in our company. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory
        authority.
      </p>

      <h2>LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING</h2>
      <p>The processing of your personal data may be based on the following legal grounds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Consent serves as our legal basis for processing operations where we obtain your consent for a specific
          processing purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          The performance of a contract, insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of
          a contract, e.g. if you purchase a product. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary
          for the performance of pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of enquiries about our products or
          services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legal obligation insofar as we are subject to a legal obligation that requires the processing of personal
          data, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vital interest in the event that vital interests of you or another natural person require the processing of
          personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legitimate interest applies on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g. when using service providers as
          part of order processing, such as shipping service providers or when carrying out statistical surveys and
          analyses and logging registration procedures. Our interest is directed towards the use of a user-friendly,
          appealing and secure presentation as well as optimisation of our website, which serves our business interests
          as well as meeting your expectations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>DURATION OF STORAGE AND ROUTINE DELETION OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
      <p>
        We process and store your personal data only for the period of time required to fulfil the purpose of storage or
        if this has been provided for, in laws or regulations. After the purpose has ceased to exist or has been
        fulfilled, your personal data will be deleted or blocked.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of blocking, deletion will take place as soon as legal, statutory or contractual retention periods
        do not conflict with this, there is no reason to assume that deletion would impair your interests worthy of
        protection and deletion would not cause a disproportionately high expense due to the special nature of the
        storage.
      </p>
      <h2>COLLECTION OF GENERAL DATA AND INFORMATION, SO-CALLED LOG FILES</h2>
      <p>
        If you visit our website for information purposes only, without providing personal data via registration or in
        any other way, only the Internet connection data that your browser transmits to our server will be processed.
        Our website collects a series of general data and information with each call, which is temporarily stored in log
        files of a server. A log file is created in the course of an automatic protocol of the processing computer
        system. The following can be recorded:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to the website (date, time and frequency)</li>
        <li>How you arrived at the website (previous page, hyperlink etc.)</li>
        <li>Amount of data sent</li>
        <li>Which browser and browser version you are using</li>
        <li>The operating system you are using</li>
        <li>Which internet service provider you use</li>
        <li>
          Your IP address, which your Internet access provider assigns to your computer when you connect to the Internet
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The legal basis for this data processing is Contract, as the collection and storage of this data is necessary
        for the operation of the website in order to ensure the functionality of the website and to deliver the content
        of our website correctly.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the data serve us to optimise our website and to ensure the security of our IT systems and the
        processing is based in this respect on our legitimate interest. For this reason, the data is stored for a
        maximum of 7 days as a technical precaution.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use this data for the purposes of advertising, market research and to design our services to meet your
        needs by creating and evaluating user profiles under pseudonyms, but only if you have not exercised your right
        to object to this use of your data (see information on the right to object under "Your rights").
      </p>

      <h2>CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP</h2>
      <p>
        In order to establish or implement the contractual relationship with our customers, it is regularly necessary to
        process the personal master, contract and payment data provided to us including but not limited to your:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email Address</li>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Payment Details</li>
        <li>Billing Address</li>
        <li>IP address (for geolocation);</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The legal basis for this processing is Contract. We also process customer and prospect data for evaluation and
        marketing purposes. This processing is carried out on the legal basis of our legitimate interest and serves our
        interest in further developing our offer and informing you specifically about Checkpoint offers. Further data
        processing may take place if you have consented or if this serves the fulfilment of a legal obligation.
      </p>

      <h2>EXERCISING OUR RIGHTS</h2>
      <p>
        We use and store your personal data and technical information to the extent necessary to prevent or prosecute
        misuse or other illegal behaviour on our website, e.g. to maintain data security in the event of attacks on our
        IT systems. This also takes place insofar as we are legally obliged to do so, for example due to official or
        court orders, and for the exercise of our rights and claims as well as for legal defence.
      </p>

      <h2>ENQUIRIES BY E-MAIL</h2>
      <p>
        When contacting us via the provided e-mail address, the personal data transmitted with the e-mail will be
        stored. This data is processed exclusively for the purpose of answering the enquiry. The legal basis for the
        processing is our legitimate interest or contract if the enquiry is aimed at concluding a contract. The data
        will be deleted when the purpose of the processing no longer applies, e.g. the enquiry has been conclusively
        answered. You can object to the processing of your personal data at any time by sending an e-mail to
        inquiry@checkpoint.tokyo.
      </p>

      <h2>COOKIES</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies on our web sites. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your terminal device and can be
        read. A distinction is made between session cookies, which are deleted as soon as you close your browser, and
        permanent cookies, which are stored beyond the individual session. Cookies can contain data that make it
        possible to recognise the device used. In some cases, however, cookies only contain information on certain
        settings that cannot be related to a specific person.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use session cookies and permanent cookies on our web sites. The processing is carried out on the basis of our
        legitimate interest and in the interest of optimising or enabling user guidance and adapting the presentation of
        our platform. You can set your browser to inform you about the placement of cookies. This makes the use of
        cookies transparent for you. You can also delete cookies at any time using the appropriate browser settings and
        prevent the setting of new cookies. Please note that our web sites may then not be displayed optimally and some
        functions may no longer be technically available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insofar as you have given your consent to this in accordance with our legitimate interest, we use the following
        cookies and other technologies from third-party providers on our web site. After the end of the purpose and the
        end of the use of the respective technology by us, the data collected in this context will be deleted. You can
        revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.
      </p>

      <h2>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>
      <p>
        Your personal data will only be passed on if there is a legal obligation to do so or to service providers and
        partner companies that have been carefully selected in advance and are contractually obliged to comply with the
        requirements of data protection law.
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Disclosure within affiliated companies pursuant to contract We pass on your personal data for the conclusion
        and processing of contracts for offers on our website to affiliated companies. This is particularly necessary so
        that you can use all our offers. If you contact a store or our customer hotline with questions, complaints or
        returns as well as other complaints, they will also receive access to your order data in order to be able to
        process your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Disclosure to service providers according to contract and our legitimate interest. For the operation and
        optimisation of our website and our services and for the processing of contracts, various service companies work
        for us, e.g. for central IT services or the hosting of our website, for the payment and delivery of products or
        for the dispatch of newsletters, to whom we pass on the data required for the fulfilment of the task (e.g. name,
        address).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these companies act for us by way of commissioned processing and may therefore use the data provided
        exclusively in accordance with our instructions. In this case, we are legally responsible for appropriate data
        protection precautions at the companies we commission. We therefore agree on specific data security measures
        with these companies and monitor them regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to order processing, in the following cases we transmit data to third parties for their own use in
        order to process the contract. In the case of payment for goods to the payment service provider specified when
        the order was placed.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not collect or store any payment transaction information such as credit card numbers or bank details
        during the payment process. You only provide this information directly to our payment service provider. The
        transmission of your personal information during an order transaction is encrypted using industry standard
        Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology, (SSL encryption version 3). Any credit card information you provide will
        not be stored by us, but will be encrypted and collected directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Disclosure to other third parties pursuant to a legal obligation and our legitimate interest. We will
        disclose your data to third parties or government agencies within the framework of existing data protection laws
        if we are legally obliged to do so, e.g. due to official or court orders, or if we are entitled to do so, e.g.
        because this is necessary for the prosecution of criminal offences or for the exercise and enforcement of our
        rights and claims.
      </p>

      <h2>DATA TRANSFER TO THIRD COUNTRIES </h2>
      <p>
        As a service provider based outside in Thailand, we take additional measures to ensure an adequate level of data
        protection for the transfer of personal data and thus ensure that the transfer is generally permissible and that
        the special requirements for a transfer to a third country are met. For further information on processing please
        refer to our processing terms.
      </p>

      <h2>CHANGES </h2>
      <p>
        This Policy Statement and our commitment to protecting the privacy of your personal data can result in changes
        to this Policy Statement. Please regularly review this policy to keep up to date with any changes.
      </p>

      <h2>QUERIES AND COMPLAINTS</h2>
      <p>
        Any comments or queries on this Policy Statement should be directed to us. If you believe that we have not
        complied with this Policy Statement or acted otherwise than in accordance with data protection law, then you
        should notify us.
